The main purpose of the application is to discover and develop intuition sense.
To accomplish this, the application generates a simple test with questions.
Your purpose is to choose the correct answer.

## The application Has two modes

### Guessing mode
In this case, the correct answer is generated before the question is asked.
You should focus on own interior and answer the question.
Then compare the feelings during giving the correct answer with the feelings during giving the wrong answer.

### Predicting mode
In this case, the correct answer is generated after the question is asked.
Just as in the case of guessing, you should focus on own inner feelings.
This mode can also be helpful in practically checking the influence of the observer on the outcome of the experiment (Quantum physics - observer effect)


Each mode has three levels of difficulty.
Easy, medium and hard.

Easy and medium level is mainly used to discover and learn to use intuition.
The hard level is an absolute test that will clearly determine whether you have contacted own intuition :wink:
